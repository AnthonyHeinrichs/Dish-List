<h1 align="center">This is Dish-List</h1>

This application was built for our final project at the Le Wagon boot camp in Berlin, March 2022. With this application we used ruby on rails, javascript, stimulus, postreSQL, css, html, and sass. 

<h4>Purpose:</h4>
Dish list is a application that was built so individuals that miss authentic dishes from their home could find a local restaurant that makes that authentic dish.

<h4>Target:</h4>
When you're craving a dish and you want it to be authentic as possible, but you don't know where to look.

<h4>Solution:</h4>
Provide list of authentic dishes from regions around the world and allow users to vote for local restaurants that make it best.

<h4>Originality:</h4>
Local restaurants are always categorized by the cuisine and general ratings, now I can search by a specific 'dish' rated by authenticity.
