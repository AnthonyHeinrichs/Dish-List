Hi, we are Anthony, Daniel and Amadeus - upcoming Tiktok stars and wanted influencers.

Together we are 'The Three Musketeers' aka. Future A-Listers.

Our hobbies are line-dance, especially to songs by Taylor Swift, Fortnight PRO-League and filming pranks.

We are political activists for the Shell Corporation and Dan loves his van.

We are two times Shark Tank applicants and almsot got into the recall at the Voice.

We are, as some might say it, living legends.

Yours,

Tony, Danni & Ammi

P.S. Sorry, we don'r date fans.
